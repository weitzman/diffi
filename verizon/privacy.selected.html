                   Our network equipment monitors conditions such as traffic flow, speed, capacity, power, and environmental conditions such as nearby Wi-Fi access points. We may also collect test information from or take pictures of equipment we install or repair.

                    Some Verizon wireless devices include system applications we provide to:

                    <li>

                    <li>
                     automatically install apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement or over the phone. The software collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may update or send you information about Verizon and third-party offers and promotions that may interest you as well as notices about apps on your device that you have not yet used. You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.

                   <p>
                    Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

                   In 2019, we shared information with third parties in ways that might be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA. We have revised these programs or otherwise made California residents ineligible to participate in them.

                  <p>
                   A previous version of our identity verification service shared Verizon Wireless customer information with third parties to verify our customer identities for other companies our customers do business with. We verify that our customers are who they say they are, protecting them against identity theft and account takeover. We modified the service in 2019 so that we no longer provide customer information to third parties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We also share certain customer information with third parties as part of our Relevant Online Advertising program available to our wireline high-speed Internet customers. The program helps make online ads more interesting and useful. Since January 1, 2020, we have removed customers with California billing addresses from this program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Finally, we shared customer personal information with consumer reporting agencies for consumer reporting and anti-fraud activity as permitted by federal law. The information may also have been used for other authentication, identification and risk prevention services offered to third parties. The information will no longer be used to provide these other services to third parties.
