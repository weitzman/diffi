          What information does Verizon collect?

      </h2>

Learn about the information Verizon collects about you, your devices and your use of products and services we provide.


</a>





<h3 class="sbs__heading cell-4-10 h4">
            We collect information when you interact with us and use our products and services.

        </h3>

The types of information we collect depends on your use of our products and services and [the ways that you interact with us](#). This may include information about:

the ways that you interact with us
You may interact with us in a variety of ways, for example, when you place an order or have questions about your account or services;  enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion; or register to receive news or public policy updates.
When you communicate with us, we may monitor or record the interaction to help us better serve you; to personalize your experiences; to train or otherwise support employees, resources or systems; and for security purposes. We may use artificial intelligence guided by humans, such as chat bots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Message, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.

<ul>- [Contact, billing and other information you provide](#)
- [How you use our services and your devices](#)
- [How you use our websites and apps](#)
- [How our network and your devices are working](#)
- [Location of your wireless devices](#)

It can also include information you provide in surveys, Verizon-sponsored promotions, and grant or job applications.<br/>

Some Verizon wireless devices include system applications we provide to:
- collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and applications on the device.
- automatically install apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement or over the phone. The software collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may update or send you information about Verizon and third-party offers and promotions that may interest you as well as notices about apps on your device that you have not yet used. You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.

Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

### 
            Cookies, social media plug-ins and other website and app tools.

        

You may see third-party advertisements on Verizon websites, services, apps and devices and see Verizon ads on others’ sites, services, apps and devices. These ads may be tailored for you based on information that we or [companies](#) acting on our behalf collect on Verizon sites and apps as well as from other sites and apps where these advertising entities also are present.

To accomplish this type of advertising, advertising entities place and access <a class="use-ajax" data-dialog-options='{"dialogClass": "ui-dialog--vzpp"}' data-dialog-type="modal" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies">
  cookies and similar technologies
</a>
 on browsers you use and access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. Information about your activities on the websites and in the apps where the entities are present is combined and used to determine whether you fall into an audience advertisers wish to reach.

Advertising that is customized based on information about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as "interest-based" advertising. In accordance with [industry self-regulatory principles](#), we require that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising techniques to deliver interest-based ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver Verizon ads on other sites. We also require them to offer you an [ability to opt out](http://www.aboutads.info) of this use of your information. 

You can visit the industry-wide [Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page ](https://www.aboutads.info/)to learn more and opt-out. Alternatively, you will see an [icon](#) ad choices icon in or around online advertisements placed using interest-based advertising techniques. You can click on the icon to learn more and opt out. Similarly, you can opt out of this type of advertising on your mobile device by going to settings and selecting "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads.”

Verizon websites and services may include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets.

We may also permit advertisers on our sites, apps and services to place ads based on certain information we have about your Verizon products and services, as well as geographic and demographic data. This information is not shared externally.

### 
            We also use de-identified and aggregated information.

        

We may de-identify or aggregate information so that Verizon or others may use it for business and marketing purposes. For example, the data we aggregate might be used to analyze, personalize and improve our services, to provide business and marketing insights to others and to help make advertising more relevant to you. [You have choices](#) about some of these uses.

## 
          Does Verizon share my information?

      

We share information within our company, with vendors and partners, and as described in this section.

### 
            We share information within Verizon.

        

We share information within Verizon for a variety of purposes, including providing you with the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the sharing of [Customer Proprietary Network Information](#) and [certain credit information](#) if you do not want us to use them to market services to you that are different from the ones you have.

We may also share information with Verizon Media as described in this or other Verizon privacy policies. Verizon Media respects the choices you make about the uses of your Verizon information.

### 
            We share information with vendors and partners.

        

We use vendors and partners to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services. We share information with them as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the purposes we allow.

We also share de-identified information with companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports.

When you purchase or use services that are offered by Verizon and one of our partners, both parties may receive your information. When this is the case, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy because it may describe uses of your information that are different from ours.

### 
            We share directory listings and Caller ID information.

        

We may publish your name, address and wireline telephone number(s) or provide this information to directory publishers, assistance services, or others. These companies can use this information in other formats or for other purposes, and they may make it available to others. We do not publish directories with wireless telephone numbers or make them available to others for listing in directories, unless you request that we do so.

We also provide your name and wireline or wireless telephone number for Caller ID and similar services.

### 
            We may disclose your information in other specific situations.

        

In addition to the circumstances described above, information that individually identifies you or your device may be shared in certain circumstances, such as:
- [To comply with the law](#)
- [To protect you, others or us](#)
- [To credit companies and collection agencies](#)
- When needed by outside auditors and regulators
- If Verizon enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets or business
- With your consent

## 
          Does Verizon have programs that allow other companies to use information about me?

      

Learn about how information may be used for third-party advertising, insights and identity verification programs.

### 
            Our advertising programs make the ads you see more personalized and useful.

        

The programs described here use information to predict whether you fit within an audience an advertiser is trying to reach and help them show relevant advertising to you. The programs may also measure advertising campaign effectiveness. [You can opt out of participating in these programs.](/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-34)

Insights are observations about groups of people that can be used to better understand consumer actions, for example, the number of people in different age groups that visited a website or retail location.

This program also may share location information with others in a way that does not personally identify you to develop additional aggregate insights, such as traffic reports.

### 
            Information security and retention. 

        

We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy, security, and the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we share this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need. They also require us to keep personally identifiable information and other sensitive records only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.

Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized [attempt to access](#), use or disclose personal information. We use our security and incident response plans to handle such incidents. You can help secure your account using [advice, tips and tools we provide](https://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/account-security).

If you become aware of a security issue, contact the [Verizon Security Control Center](https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/account/manage-account/security/security-control-center) and we will work with you to address your concern.

###

## 
          Do I have specific rights under privacy laws in the United States?

      

You may have additional rights under the Cable Act and under state laws, including California, Maine and Nevada privacy laws.

### 
            Information about the Cable Act

        

The “Cable Act” (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended) limits the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators and requires operators to tell you, to the extent that the Cable Act applies to the services you purchase, about the [personally identifiable information](#) they collect. 

We may use our cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render cable service or other services provided to you over the cable system and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. We may collect additional personally identifiable information with your prior consent. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information without consent where necessary to render services and to conduct legitimate business activities related to the services we provide.

We may also disclose your name and address as long as you have the ability to prevent or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, your viewing or other uses of the services we provide. We will give you the opportunity to prevent or limit sharing if we decide to share name and address information in this way.

We may also share personally identifiable information if it is required by law to comply with [valid legal process](#).

We retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. If you would like to access your personally identifiable information, may email us at privacyoffice@verizon.com to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to ensure that corrections are made.

If you believe that your Cable Act privacy rights have been violated, please email us at privacyoffice@verizon.com and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

### 
            California Consumer Privacy Act

        

The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](#) gives you specific rights as a California resident

The law provides you with the right to know what information we collect about you and how we use it, to access and delete that information within certain limitations, to tell us not to sell personal information about you and to not be discriminated against for invoking these rights.

**Your right to know. **We describe the personal information we collect and how we use it in this [privacy policy](/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy?scrollto#acc-item-30)[.](/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy?scrollto=index-1#acc-item-30) The information we collect varies depending on your interactions with us and the products and services you use. The California law requires us to let you know the [categories of personal information](#) we collect and use.

Categories of personal information we collect include: identifiers; records of products and services you purchase or use and how you use them; financial data; website, network or device activity; geolocation information; biometric information; professional and educational information; audio or visual information; inferences and insights about you; protected classifications; and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated or linked with you.

We collect personal information when you interact with us and use our products and services, [from certain third-party sources](/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#acc-item-30) and from our network and the devices you use. We use this information for [business and commercial purposes](#) as they are defined by the CCPA. [Service providers](#) we use to do work on our behalf (also called vendors in other sections of this privacy policy) may use information for the same purposes. We may also share information for legal compliance, for credit and collections purposes, with your consent and as further described in other sections of this policy.

We share information with service providers as necessary for them to perform work for us. They are required to protect the information they receive from us or collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow.

Business and commercial purposes include providing services to you; communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance purposes. Examples and additional detail about these types of uses can be found in other sections of this privacy policy.

**Your right to access. **You have the right to request access to specific pieces and categories of personal information we collected about you in the past twelve months. You can do this by accessing our [Privacy Dashboard](https://www.verizon.com/privacy/your-data) or calling 1.800.333.3972. 

**Your right to delete. **You have the right to request that we delete personal information we have about you unless we need it for specific reasons described by the CCPA. You can do this by accessing our [Privacy Dashboard](https://www.verizon.com/privacy/your-data) or calling 1.800.333.3972. We retain personal information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes and then securely delete it.

**Your right to say “[Do not sell my personal information](/about/privacy/do-not-sell-my-info).”** The CCPA gives you the right to say no to the sale of personal information.

We do not sell information that personally identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address. We may share that type of information with directory publishers and for caller ID purposes, excluding customers who have subscribed (at no charge) to unlisted or unpublished numbers.  

We allow Verizon Media and third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through <a class="use-ajax" data-dialog-options='{"dialogClass": "ui-dialog--vzpp"}' data-dialog-type="modal" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies">

 mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins. These ad entities use information they collect to help us provide more relevant Verizon advertisements and other advertising purposes. This activity may be considered a sale under the CCPA. Visit [Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice](https://youradchoices.com/control) to learn more about how you can limit this type of advertising. You can opt out of this type of advertising in your apps using your device settings to “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (on Android devices).

In 2019, we shared information with third parties in ways that might be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA. We have revised these programs or otherwise made California residents ineligible to participate in them.

A previous version of our identity verification service shared Verizon Wireless customer information with third parties to verify our customer identities for other companies our customers do business with. We verify that our customers are who they say they are, protecting them against identity theft and account takeover. We modified the service in 2019 so that we no longer provide customer information to third parties.

We also share certain customer information with third parties as part of our Relevant Online Advertising program available to our wireline high-speed Internet customers. The program helps make online ads more interesting and useful. Since January 1, 2020, we have removed customers with California billing addresses from this program.

Finally, we shared customer personal information with consumer reporting agencies for consumer reporting and anti-fraud activity as permitted by federal law. The information may also have been used for other authentication, identification and risk prevention services offered to third parties. The information will no longer be used to provide these other services to third parties.

**Your right to not be discriminated against.** We do not [discriminate](#) against you if you exercise any rights described in this section.

We will not deny goods or services, charge different prices or rates for goods or services or provide you a different level or quality of goods and services. You also have the right to receive information about any financial incentives we offer to you

### 
            Maine Broadband Customer Privacy Rights

        

The [Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act](#), effective on July 1, 2020, gives you additional privacy rights when we are your broadband Internet access service provider. The Maine law gives you the right to control certain ways that we use or share information we have about you and requires that we provide you with a notice of your rights and our obligations under this law. We do this in this section.

The law applies to current or former subscribers of mass market broadband Internet access service in Maine. It also applies to applicants for this service. 

The Maine law also requires us to take reasonable measures to protect your [customer personal information](#). We describe this in an earlier section of this [privacy policy](/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy?scroll#acc-item-35).

Maine law defines “customer personal information” as personally identifying information about a customer or information from a customer’s use of broadband Internet access service. 

We will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your broadband customer personal information except for [purposes allowed under the Maine law](#) or with your affirmative consent. We may ask you for this consent when we interact with you. For example, we may ask to use your broadband customer personal information to market [additional services](#) to you when you call us or come into our stores.

 Maine law allows us to use and/or share broadband customer personal information to provide and maintain your broadband services; market and advertise our communications-related services to you; comply with lawful court orders; bill and collect; protect users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of or subscription to such services; or provide location information in response to certain emergency situations.

By “additional services,” we mean Verizon or partner services that are not communications-related.** **


The Maine law also provides you with a right to opt-out of any use or sharing of data that is not customer personal information under the law. At this time, we do not collect information about you as a broadband customer that is not customer personal information. If we begin collecting such information in the future, we will give you the right to opt out of its use and sharing. 

We will not refuse to provide you with broadband service, charge you a penalty, or offer you a discount based on whether you agree that we can use or share your broadband customer personal information.
