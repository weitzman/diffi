   Effective Date: April 20, 2018
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  These User Terms of Service (the
  <strong>
   “User Terms”
  </strong>
  ) govern your access and use of our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the
  <strong>
   “Services”
  </strong>
  ).  Please read them carefully.  Even though you are signing onto an existing workspace, these User Terms apply to you as a user of the Services.  We are grateful you’re here.
 </p>
 <h2>
  First things First
 </h2>
 <h3>
  These User Terms are Legally Binding
 </h3>
 <p>
  These User Terms are a legally binding contract between you and us.  As part of these User Terms, you agree to comply with the most recent version of our
  <a data-no-clog="1" href="https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy">
   Acceptable Use Policy
  </a>
  , which is incorporated by reference into these User Terms.  If you access or use the Services, or continue accessing or using the Services after being notified of a change to the User Terms or the
  <a data-no-clog="1" href="https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy">
   Acceptable Use Policy
  </a>
  , you confirm that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the User Terms and the
  <a data-no-clog="1" href="https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy">
   Acceptable Use Policy
  </a>
  .  “We”, “our” and “us” currently refers to the applicable Slack entity in the Contract (defined below).
 </p>
 <h2>
  Customer’s Choices and Instructions
 </h2>
 <h3>
  You are an Authorized User on a Workspace Controlled by a “Customer”
 </h3>
 <p>
  An organization or other third party that we refer to in these User Terms as
  <strong>
   “Customer”
  </strong>
  has invited you to a workspace (i.e., a unique domain where a group of users may access the Services, as further described in our
  <a href="https://slack.com/help">
   Help Center
  </a>
  pages).  If you are joining one of your employer’s workspaces, for example, Customer is your employer.  If you are joining a workspace created by your friend using her personal email address to work on her new startup idea, she is our Customer and she is authorizing you to join her workspace.
 </p>
 <h3>
  What This Means for You—and for Us
 </h3>
 <p>
  Customer has separately agreed to our
  <a data-no-clog="1" href="https://slack.com/terms-of-service">
   Customer Terms of Service
  </a>
  or entered into a written agreement with us (in either case, the
  <strong>
   “Contract”
  </strong>
  ) that permitted Customer to create and configure a workspace so that you and others could join (each invitee granted access to the Services, including you, is an
  <strong>
   “Authorized User”
  </strong>
  ).  The Contract contains our commitment to deliver the Services to Customer, who may then invite Authorized Users to join its workspace(s).  When an Authorized User (including, you) submits content or information to the Services, such as messages or files (
  <strong>
   “Customer Data”
  </strong>
  ), you acknowledge and agree that the Customer Data is owned by Customer and the Contract provides Customer with many choices and control over that Customer Data.  For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign workspaces, share channels, or consolidate your workspace or channels with other workspaces or channels, and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data.  Please check out our
  <a href="https://slack.com/help/categories/200122103-Team-Administration">
   Help Center
  </a>
  pages for more detail on our different Service plans and the options available to Customer.
 </p>
 <h3>
  The Relationship Between You, Customer and Us
 </h3>
 <p>
  AS BETWEEN US AND CUSTOMER, YOU AGREE THAT IT IS SOLELY CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO (A) INFORM YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USERS OF ANY RELEVANT CUSTOMER POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND ANY SETTINGS THAT MAY IMPACT THE PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA; (B) OBTAIN ANY RIGHTS, PERMISSIONS OR CONSENTS FROM YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE LAWFUL USE OF CUSTOMER DATA AND THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES; (C) ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA UNDER THE CONTRACT IS LAWFUL; AND (D) RESPOND TO AND RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USER RELATING TO OR BASED ON CUSTOMER DATA, THE SERVICES OR CUSTOMER’S FAILURE TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.  SLACK MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO YOU RELATING TO THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “ AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.
 </p>
 <h2>
  A Few Ground Rules
 </h2>
 <h3>
  You Must be Over the Legal Age
 </h3>
 <p>
  To the extent prohibited by applicable law, the Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of sixteen.  You represent that you are over the legal age and are the intended recipient of Customer’s invitation to the Services.  You may not access or use the Services for any purpose if either of the representations in the preceding sentence is not true.  Without limiting the foregoing, you must be of legal working age.
 </p>
 <h3>
  While You Are Here, You Must Follow the Rules
 </h3>
 <p>
  To help ensure a safe and productive work environment, all Authorized Users must comply with our
  <a data-no-clog="1" href="https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy">
   Acceptable Use Policy
  </a>
  and any applicable policies established by Customer. If you see inappropriate behavior or content, please report it to your Primary Owner or employer.
 </p>
 <h3>
  You Are Here At the Pleasure of Customer (and Us)
 </h3>
 <p>
  These User Terms remain effective until Customer’s subscription for you expires or terminates, or your access to the Services has been terminated by Customer or us.  Please contact Customer if you at any time or for any reason wish to terminate your account, including due to a disagreement with any updates to these User Terms or the
  <a data-no-clog="1" href="https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy">
   Acceptable Use Policy
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <h2>
  Limitation of Liability
 </h2>
 <p>
  If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract, User Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, or any of our other policies that can simply be remedied by Customer’s removal of certain Customer Data or taking other action, we will, in most cases, ask Customer to take action rather than intervene.  We may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action (including disabling your account) if Customer does not take appropriate action or we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties.  IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  UNLESS YOU ARE ALSO A CUSTOMER (AND WITHOUT LIMITATION TO OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE CONTRACT), YOU WILL HAVE NO FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO US FOR A BREACH OF THESE USER TERMS.  OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY BREACH OF THE USER TERMS IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IN THE AGGREGATE.  THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND DO NOT LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN EQUITABLE RELIEF.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Application of Consumer Law
 </h3>
 <p>
  Slack is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply.  If however any consumer laws (e.g., in Australia, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)) do apply and cannot otherwise be lawfully excluded, nothing in these User Terms will restrict, exclude or modify any statutory warranties, guarantees, rights or remedies you have, and our liability is limited (at our option) to the replacement, repair or resupply of the Services or the pro-rata refund to Customer of pre-paid fees for your subscription covering the remainder of the term.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Survival
 </h3>
 <p>
  The sections titled “The Relationship Between You, Customer, and Us,” “Limitation of Liability,”  and “Survival,” and all of the provisions under the general heading “General Provisions” will survive any termination or expiration of the User Terms.
 </p>
 <h2>
  General Provisions
 </h2>
