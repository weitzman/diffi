- Enabling [<u>dynamic pricing</u>](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/why-are-prices-higher-than-normal---?nodeId=34212e8b-d69a-4d8a-a923-095d3075b487), in which the price of a ride, or the delivery fee for Uber Eats orders, is determined based on constantly varying factors such as the estimated time and distance, the predicted route, estimated traffic, and the number of riders and drivers using Uber at a given moment.<br/>- Matching available drivers and delivery persons to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors. Please see [<u>here</u>](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) for further information about our matching process.<br/>- Determining driver and delivery person ratings, and deactivating drivers, riders, and delivery persons with low ratings. For more information about how ratings are determined and used, please see [<u>here</u>](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/how-is-my-rating-determined---?nodeId=bfea011b-3fde-4647-8b4a-5cc1bbc37899) for rider ratings, [<u>here</u>](https://www.uber.com/drive/resources/how-ratings-work/) for driver ratings, and [<u>here</u>](https://help.uber.com/partners/article/how-do-delivery-ratings-work?nodeId=7671ae08-cf2a-44fd-951e-2aa19ec74458) for delivery person ratings. Please also see the section below titled “Ratings look-up” for further information.<br/>- Deactivating users who are identified as having engaged in fraud or activities that may otherwise harm Uber, its users, and others. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Uber’s referral program, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation.<br/>- Using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee.

****Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Uber may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this policy.****
|Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the category of user to whom the data relates, the type of data, and the purposes for which we collected the data. Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber’s website (riders and delivery recipients [<u>here</u>](https://help.uber.com/h/24010fe7-7a67-4ee5-9938-c734000b144a); drivers and delivery persons [<u>here</u>](https://help.uber.com/h/55ae2bb5-b102-4ab0-9ed3-32f4db95f0e5)).Following an account deletion request, Uber deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 7 years after a deletion request. For riders and delivery recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.

Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber’s website (riders and delivery recipients [<u>here</u>](https://help.uber.com/h/24010fe7-7a67-4ee5-9938-c734000b144a); drivers and delivery persons [<u>here</u>](https://help.uber.com/h/55ae2bb5-b102-4ab0-9ed3-32f4db95f0e5)).

|We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so. Such grounds may vary depending on where our users are located, but generally include processing personal data: **A- To provide requested services and features**In order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data. This includes: - User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain user accounts; verify user identity; communicate with users about their trips, orders, and accounts; and enable users to make payments or receive earnings - Background trip information, which is used to verify an applicant’s eligibility to be a driver or delivery person- Driver and delivery person location data, which we use to track trips and assist with navigation- Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance Uber’s services, including to determine incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings- Transaction information- Information relating to customer support <br/>**B- For purposes of the legitimate interests of Uber or other parties**This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our users’ safety and security. For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uber’s apps. We also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users). This also includes purposes such as combating fraud; improving our services, direct marketing, research, and development; and enforcing Uber’s Terms of Service.<br/><br/>In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.**C- To fulfill Uber’s legal obligations **For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our users’ trips and deliveries, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities. We collect and use personal data to comply with such laws. Uber may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes. Uber may also share information with public health authorities where required or permitted by law. For more information about such sharing, please see Uber’s [<u>Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - United States</u>](https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-law-enforcement-united-states/en-US/), [<u>Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - Outside the US</u>](https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-law-enforcement-outside-the-united-states/en/), and [<u>Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents</u>](https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-third-party-data-requests/en/).**D- With consent **Uber may collect and use personal data based on the user’s consent. For example, we may collect personal data through voluntary surveys. Responses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected. <br/><br/>A user who has provided consent to a collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time. However, the user will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal data.
