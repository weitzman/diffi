     </p>
     <p>
      Welcome to PayPal!
     </p>
     <p>
      This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc. governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services. It applies to U.S. PayPal accounts only. If you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S. PayPal account and use the PayPal services. If you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S. PayPal account and use the PayPal services.
     </p>
     <p>
      By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement. The terms include an
      <a href="#s6-agreement-arbitrate">
       agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration
      </a>

      We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      All PayPal accounts let you do things like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <a href="#sending-money">
        Send
       </a>

       things online, using mobile devices or in stores.
      </li>
      <li>
       Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the
       <a href="#business-accounts">
        required identifying information
       </a>
       you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account. The term “Cash Account” in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account. More information about Cash Accounts can be found in the
       <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cashagreement-full">
        PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions
       </a>
       .
      </li>
      <li>
       Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services. You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Personal PayPal accounts
     </h4>
     <p>
      If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you. With a personal PayPal account you can do things like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Send and request money from friends and family.
      </li>
      <li>
       Buy goods and services.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account. You can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.
     </p>
     <a class="anchor" name="business-accounts">
     </a>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Business PayPal accounts
     </h4>
     <p>
      We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated. With a business PayPal account, you can do things like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.
      </li>
      <li>
       Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.
      </li>
      <li>
       Sign up for
       <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant">
        PayPal products
       </a>
       that meet your business needs.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose. You also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Commercial Entity Status
     </h4>
     <p>
      If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments. In this case, these
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/ceagreement-full">
       Commercial Entity Agreements
      </a>
      will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.

      You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed. When you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions. If you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must

       withdraw
      </a>
      or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account. If you have a business PayPal account, you must

      <a href="https://www.paypal-gifts.com">
       PayPal Digital Gifts

      In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:

      <li value="5">

You can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it. Please keep your payment method information current (e.g. credit card number and expiration date). If this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part. If you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account. If we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method. You may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner. To do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card. After the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.

      To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency. Certain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold. If the money is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our

      You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account. You may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates. PayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.

     <h4>
      How we convert currency
     </h4>
     <p>
      If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#statement-13">
       currency conversion spread
      </a>
      applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion. The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior
      <a href="#business-days">
       Business Day
      </a>
      ; or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).
     </p>
     <p>
      For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary. The applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#statement-13">
       Currency conversion

     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Currency conversion choices
     </h4>
     <p>
      When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer. You may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network. Currency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement. If your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.
     </p>
     <p>
      PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.

      <a href="#s2-payment-methods">
       payment method
      </a>
      linked to your PayPal account. This includes, for example:

     <ul>
      <li>
       Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.
      </li>
      <li>
       Sending money to a seller for goods or services.
      </li>
      <li>
       Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.
      </li>
      <li>
       Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account. If they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something. In addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction. In these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account. In that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days). If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction. If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including a
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#statement-currency">

      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/business-payments-agreement">

      Payment review
     </h4>
     <p>
      When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed. When this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item. As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased. If we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item. If we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.

     <h4>
      Automatic payments
     </h4>
     <p>
      You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller. This agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis. Examples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a “billing agreement,” "subscription," "recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” "preauthorized transfer" or "preapproved payment."
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3
      <a href="#business-days">
       <strong>
        Business Days
       </strong>
      </a>
      before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/home">
       <strong>
        PayPal Help Center
       </strong>
      </a>
      , or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped. If you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made. If the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#statement-currency">
       currency conversion spread
      </a>
      ) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.

     <h4>
      Refunds
     </h4>
     <p>
      When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account. If we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one. If you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under
      <a href="#s1-holding-balance">
       Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds
      </a>
      for personal PayPal accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account. If we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one. If you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under
      <a href="#s1-holding-balance">
       Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds
      </a>
      for personal PayPal accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a
       <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#statement-currency">
        currency conversion spread
       </a>
       ) used at the time of the original payment will apply.
      </li>
      <li>
       Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a
       <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#statement-currency">
        currency conversion spread
       </a>
       ) on the date of the refund will apply.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Money will be refunded in the currency you paid; or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency; or we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S. dollars.

     <h4>
      Selecting a preferred payment method
     </h4>
     <p>
      You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method. You can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">
       <strong>
        www.paypal.com
       </strong>
      </a>
      or in the PayPal app. There may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no preferred payment method, it's still your choice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third-party website you are using to complete the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction. You can also click on the “Manage” link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Backup payment method
     </h4>
     <p>
      Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable. In those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction. Note that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or
      <a href="#preapproved-payments1">
       automatic payments
      </a>
      . If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.
     </p>

     </p>
     <h4>
      Sending money to friends and family
     </h4>
     <p>
      When you send money to friends and family within the U.S. using balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases. Remember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the “Change” link on the Send Money page. If you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Automatic payments
     </h4>
     <p>
      Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster. Often, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase. To help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information; see Link or Unlink a Payment Method.
     </p>
     <p>
      When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement. You can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller. If you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1. Cash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we've been able to verify the
      <a href="#business-accounts">
       <strong>
        required identifying information
       </strong>
      </a>
      you provide to us); 2. Bank account; 3. PayPal co-branded debit card; 4. PayPal co-branded credit card; 5. Debit card; 6. Credit card; and 7. E-check. This is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Bank account transfers
     </h4>
     <p>
      When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient. For these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify. You authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank. The terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account. If you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank. Similarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      E-check
     </h4>
     <p>
      E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank. This process usually takes 3-5
      <a href="#business-days">
       Business Days
      </a>
      , but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      Pay with Rewards
     </h4>
     <p>
      PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal's Pay with Rewards program. PayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal's Pay with Rewards program. The exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.
     </p>
     <p>
      All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer. Pay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement. Your issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).
     </p>
     <p>
      There may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment. Only rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used. Because your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens. For more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see

     <h4>
      Debit card processing
     </h4>
     <p>
      PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network. If we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.

When you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller's loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale. It is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary. It is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled. PayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.

      When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Purchase Protection program. When applicable, PayPal's Purchase Protection program entitles you to coverage for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim is eligible for the Purchase Protection program. PayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
     </p>
     <p>
      IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim. PayPal's Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to coverage for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
     </p>
     <p>
      PayPal's Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or
      </li>
      <li>
       You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under

      Our online dispute resolution process
     </h4>
     <p>
      If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&amp;nav=0.4">
       <strong>
        Resolution Center
       </strong>
      </a>
      to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program. You may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent. The steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:
     </p>
     <p>
      Step 1:
      <strong>
       Open a dispute
      </strong>
      within 180 days of the date you made the payment. This might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute. If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2. We will place a
      <a href="#holds">
       hold
      </a>
      on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Step 2:
      <strong>
       Escalate the dispute to a claim
      </strong>
      for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute. You can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&amp;nav=0.4">
       <strong>
        Resolution Center
       </strong>
      </a>
      . The seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point. PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.
     </p>
     <p>
      Step 3:
      <strong>
       Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information
      </strong>
      , after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement. PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third-party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies. You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.
     </p>
     <p>
      Step 4:
      <strong>
       Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner
      </strong>
      , if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proof of delivery means:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       For transactions that total less than $750 U.S. dollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.
      </li>
      <li>
       For transactions that total $750 U.S. dollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery. If the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.
      </li>
     </ul>
