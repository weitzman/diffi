     Why do we use cookies?
    </div>
    <div>
     Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Facebook Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay in your browser until they expire or you delete them. While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Facebook Products, we use them for the following purposes:
     <div>
      <div class="mtm _50f7">
       Authentication
      </div>
      We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you're logged in so that we can make it easier for you to access the Facebook Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.
      <blockquote>
       <i>
        For example:
       </i>
       We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Facebook Pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you don't have to keep logging in to Facebook and so you can more easily log in to Facebook via third-party apps and websites. For example, we use the "c_user" and "xs" cookies for this purpose, with a lifespan of 365 days.

      <blockquote>
       <i>
        For example:
       </i>
       Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Facebook account without authorisation, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked. This includes, for example, our "sb" and "dbln" cookies, which enable us to identify your browser securely.
      </blockquote>
      We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Facebook Products.
      <blockquote>
       <i>
        For example:
       </i>
       Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Facebook accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm. Our "csrf" cookie, for example, helps us prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Facebook accounts.

      We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organisations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote.
      <blockquote>
       <i>
        For example:
       </i>
       Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have previously visited a business's website, purchased its products or used its apps and to recommend products and services based on that activity. Cookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you see an ad so you don't see the same ad over and over again. For example, the "fr" cookie is used to deliver, measure and improve the relevancy of ads, with a lifespan of 90 days.
      </blockquote>
      We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Facebook Products.
      <blockquote>
       <i>
        For example:
       </i>
       We use cookies to count the number of times that an ad is shown and to calculate the cost of those ads. We also use cookies to measure how often people do things, such as make a purchase following an ad impression. The "_fbp" cookie identifies browsers for the purposes of providing advertising and site analytics services and has a lifespan of 90 days. .
      </blockquote>
      Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.
      <blockquote>

        For example:
       </i>
       We can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over and over again across the different devices that you use.

      Cookies also allow us to provide insights about the people who use the Facebook Products, as well as the people who interact with the ads, websites and apps of our advertisers and the businesses that use the Facebook Products.

       We use cookies to help businesses understand the kinds of people who like their Facebook Page or use their apps so that they can provide more relevant content and develop features that are likely to be interesting to their customers.

      We also use cookies, such as our "oo" cookie, which has a lifespan of five years, to help you opt out of seeing ads from Facebook based on your activity on third-party websites.
