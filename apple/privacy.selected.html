          At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
          <strong>
           That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
          </strong>
          This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data.
         </p>
         <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers how
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en/affiliated-company/">
           Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
          </a>
          handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.

          There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.

          Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
          <strong>
           individuals under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
          </strong>
          . That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children's personal data safe.
         </p>
         <p>
          To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple ID. A child Apple ID may be created by the
          <strong>
           parent
          </strong>
          or, in the case of a Managed Apple ID, by the
          <strong>
           child's educational institution
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Parents.
           </strong>
           To create a child account, parents must review the
           <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/parent-disclosure/">
            Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
           </a>
           , which describes how Apple handles children's personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Educational Institutions.
           </strong>
           Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called "Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the
           <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/education/apple-school-manager/">
            Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
           </a>
           which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
           <br/>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If we learn that a child's personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
         </p>

          In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
         </p>
         <p>
          In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.

         <p>
          Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format that you can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this data to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

         <p>
          <strong>
           Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as nonpersonal data.
          </strong>
          However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data. In addition, Apple sometimes combines nonpersonal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.

         <p>
          Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News or the Stocks app and in the App Store. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS or iPadOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by choosing Apple menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy, clicking Privacy, clicking Advertising, and deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or Apple News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.
